    <h2>Player’s Turn</h2>
    <p>During a players’ turn they can either add cards to the play area or they can pass their turn.</p>
    <p>A player can play one to all four of the cards from their hand. Cards can only be added to the play area under
        certain circumstances though. When playing cards to the play area all cards must either all match or all differ
        in
        the three different card properties (color, shape, number). For example a line can consist of all green cards or
        all
        of the cards have to be different colors. All of the cards can be a circle or they all have to be a different
        shape.
        All of the cards can be a two or all of the cards have to be a different number. No card may be played that
        breaks
        this rule.</p>
    <p>See example of lots below.</p>

    <h2>Rules of play</h2>
    <p>All cards played also have to follow these additional rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All cards that are played can only be played within one horizontal or vertical line.</li>
        <li>A player can play tiles in any order or on both sides of cards already played on the board but all the cards
            played can only be played in one line.
        </li>
        <li>At least one card that is played has to connect to at least one card already on the board.</li>
        <li>Even though cards can only be played in one line, they may end up creating multiple lines or adding to
            multiple
        </li>
        lines.
        <li>Only four cards may be played in each line. When a four card line is created, a lot has been formed. When a
            lot is
            formed all points scored in a turn are doubled.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>Players score points for every line created and/or added to by the cards played. Each line is counted individually
    and cards that are used in multiple lines are counted in each line scored. Each card awards the player points equal
    to the number on the card. So a line with a two, three and four card would be worth nine points.</p>
    <p>A player’s score for a turn doubles every time they either play all four of their cards or play the fourth card in a
    line. These bonuses compound which means the player’s score could double multiple times if they play all four cards
    or they play the fourth card for a couple lines.</p>
